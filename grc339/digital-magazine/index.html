                             <p> Last fall, I studied abroad in Italy for four months. These 4 months helped me develop my culinary skills like no other. I got the chance to learn so much and experience the world of culinary and groceries in Italy and other countries. I was blessed to have lived right next to the San Ambrogio market with access to local fresh meats, cheeses, and produce. It was my dream and gave me so much space to cook and try things I never had in the States. I will never have access to these amazing ingredients again unless I move, so I actually may start crying. Cheers to pushing myself, learning, and experimenting.</p>

                             <p>Ah, Hosting. You either love it or you hate it. Personally, I have a love-hate relationship. Cooking for others is definitely a stressful task, but when executed well provides results that make the whole process worth it. In order to successfully execute a dinner party there are four key components. Good Planning, Good Styling, Good Food, and Enough Wine to Allow Others to Not Notice Your Impending Stress and Imperfections. </p>

                            <p>When I was in high school I used to work at an authentic Japanese ramen shop. I learned a lot about how to make a good fucking ramen. One of my friends is Japanese and pescetarian, so I tasked myself with developing an umami-filled broth without animal bones. I’d say it turned out pretty good.</p>

                            <h2>Chorizo Manchego & Swiss Chard Empanadas</h2>
                             <p>For this recipe, I used classic Spanish ingredients, but learned that the traditional Galician Spanish empanada is made with tuna and in a pie form. I also got lost in a Latin American empanada rabbit hole. Chilean empanadas are usually larger and baked, while Argentinian empanadas are usually smaller and fried.

                            <h2>Is Brunello Di Montalcino Worth The Hype?</h2>
                             <p>One of the most famous wines. Brunello di Montalcino is a red wine produced in the town of Montalcino within Tuscany, Italy. This wine is known as premium, coming with high price points for the average wine drinker. When I was in Italy, I got the chance to drink it, and wow do I have some thoughts. </p>

                            <h2>Shrimp Tacos</h2>
                             <p>Do you even make your own tortillas? Even though I already know the answer to this question, I still need to inform you guys on how easy it is. Mixed with grilled shrimp, a cabbage slaw, cotija, and not one but TWO crazyyyy sauces. Bruh. Delectable. I love sauce. I put sauce on everything. The sauces for these tacos blow them out of this world. Avocado, green chili cilantro, and a smoky adobo chili crema? Yeah, get cooking.</p>

                                <p>I’m sure you’ve heard of the new, trendy olive oil brand Graza by now. The colorful and fun marketing of the brand has easily caught the eyes of foodies to professional chefs alike. Although, like many others, I have my skepticism. Sure, the olive oil LOOKS cool, but does it taste good? In this review, I’m here to find out.</p>

                                <p>Paella. One of the hardest dishes to make, if you want to make it right. I’ve attempted a bomb seafood paella many times, not without running into technical difficulties. At first, I put emphasis on the seafood stock, which is extremely important, but I realized the key to a good paella is all in the technique of cooking the rice. It's easy to overcook, undercook, and inhibit a crispy socarrat. </p>

                                <p>Florence, Italy, is home to a diversity of culinary pleasures ranging from high-end restaurants to tiny street-side bars perfect for smoking a Vogue alongside a morning cappuccino. Many tourists come to Italy hoping for the best pizza and pasta, but the issue is that they don’t know where to look. More importantly, they don’t know HOW to look. I wouldn’t be caught dead eating a carbonara next to the Duomo, or shopping at an “artisan truffle store” right across from the Uffizi Gallery. After living there, I managed to figure out the tips and tricks of where to eat, and compiled a list of my favorite places for every vibe.</p>

                                <p>So… a couple years ago I worked with my Italian friend to translate the original ragu bolognese recipe from the Bologna Chamber of Commerce’s website…and dare I say it was fucking buss. This ragu will make you think differently about every other bolognese you have ever had in your life. Simmering for 30 minutes? Never heard of it. Meat melting in your mouth? Legendary. Fresh egg tagliatelle, I think you get the point. Get ready to go into the deepest food coma in your life, after devoting 4 hours to this recipe, of course.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes you don't want to eat a big slab of meat. And that’s ok. Honestly, I don’t know why it's become antagonized to not want to eat meat for every meal. With these salmon burgers, you’re able to get your fish on. A soft salmon patty with a toasted brioche bun, crunchy fennel, arugula, and a spicy Thai basil aioli. Like holy buss. It’s time to get a little creative with it. After all, there’s really no wrong answers when it comes to dressing your burger. Unless you put American cheese on a salmon burger. That’s foul.</p>

                                <p>I love brunch. I think brunch is very underrated. People need to be more enthusiastic about brunch. But please don’t bullshit your brunch. Some eggs, bagels, and pancakes? Boring. Brunch needs creativity. Brunch is not just breakfast, it’s a party. It’s time to bring your controversial gluten-free blueberry protein muffins. It’s not the time to bring boxed pastries straight from Cal Fresh. Brunch is where the non-breakfast eaters get to experience something they never realized was real. Like my eggs Benedict, and sweet potato, chorizo, and rainbow chard hash. </p>
