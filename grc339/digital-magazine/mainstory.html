            <h2>Thanksgiving in Italy</h2>
            <p>Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, and I cook the entire dinner for my family every year. Even though I wasn’t in America, I still tasked myself to cook a whole spread for my roommates, and it turned out amazing. I roasted a chicken, made a roasted garlic mash, a delicious butternut squash mac and cheese, balsamic green beans, chicken gravy, and a lettuce radicchio salad to add some “healthiness”. It was so special and amazing, and the only time I wanted to feel American in Italy.  </p>

            <p>This was my first time ever cooking octopus, and it was gross. I bought a whole octopus from the local fish market and had to cut off its head and eyes while its guts fell out of its head just to make this. Anyways, I braised the octopus in a tomato sauce on low to try not to overcook it, and it was good. Not perfect, but for the first time, it was good.  </p>
            <p>But the duck ragu though, holy shit. This was also my first time cooking duck, and when I bought it from the local meat market, I watched the butcher cut off the duck's legs right in front of me. It was that fresh, fresh shit and there was still loads of feathers on it when i brought it home. Sorry vegetarians. I love ragu, and I had tasted many delicious duck ragus in Florence, so I tried to create one of my own. I seared and simmered the duck for hours, added some wine, mirepoix, orange, and parmesan, and wow. There are definitely some things I would do differently, but here's to cooking interesting meats in a foreign country.  </p>

            <p>We're stocking it up. Stock is one of my favorite things to make, and honestly, before Italy, I would mainly buy store-bought stocks instead of making my own. Then I discovered how easy it is, and since then I haven’t gone back. It is also so so fun. I planned on making a French onion soup, so I had to blanch and boil a bunch of beef bones to make a flavorful stock. I got the bones from my local butcher for so so cheap, cooked them for a couple of hours, and ended up with an amazing collagen liquid. I also added a variety of herbs and mireopix at the end. Broth science is so fun!</p>

                  <h2>Italian Sickness Soup</h2>
                  <p>This is one of my favorite soups I've ever made. A homemade chicken stock with roasted chicken, pastina, lemon, spinach, dill, carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. The secret ingredients were a parmesan rind and egg yolk at the end to add umami and creaminess. My spin on avgolemono, perfect for when my roommates were sick. </p>

                  <h2>French Onion Soup</h2>
                  <p>French onion soup is one of the most hearty and warming soups I know. For this soup, I used my own beef broth, lots of caramelized onions, and a lot of delicious Comté cheese. The broiling at the end to brown the cheese is the cherry on top. </p>

                  <h2>Truffle Tagliatelle</h2>
                  <p>The amount of money I spent on two black truffles was insane, but so worth it. The fact that I could even buy whole truffles, white ones too, was crazy. My friends in Barcelona were visiting, so I whipped up black truffle parmesan tagliatelle, a Sicilian fennel orange salad, and a giant charcuterie board with local Tuscan meats and cheese like finocchiona and Pecorino Toscano. </p>

                  <h2>Roasted Chicken</h2>
                  <p>I think I roasted 6 chickens in the four months I was in Italy. I got really into it. It's so easy and fun to experiment with the different ways to brine, baste, and all that jazz in order to get different levels of tenderness, juiciness, and crispiness. Currently, I am still on the hunt for the perfect roast chicken technique, but I believe I will get there soon.</p>
